## Author: Jayson Van Dam

### Overview
My goal with this blog post is to get Raylib's
[Arkanoid example](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-games/blob/master/classics/src/arkanoid.c)
working in a web browser using the Emscripten compiler to compile C++ source code
into WebAssembly. I will be following [this guide](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Web-%28HTML5%29)
to install both Emscripten and Raylib on Windows.

### Emscripten installation steps

### Difficulty of Raylib installation
